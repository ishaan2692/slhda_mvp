SLHDA_MVP Documentation Summary

Project Overview:
SLHDA_MVP stands for Scalar-Ledger Hybrid Data Architecture (MVP). It is a high-performance, flexible framework designed for storing numerical data independently of its structure. The framework enables dynamic reconstruction, semantic aliasing, and HPC-grade workflows while maintaining zero-copy memory efficiency. It is particularly suited for multi-scale simulations, tensorized data workflows, and efficient batch retrievals.

Key Features:
- Contiguous scalar storage: All numerical data is stored as float64 scalars for cache-friendly HPC access.
- JSON ledger: Stores object metadata, shapes, and semantic tags for reconstruction.
- Dynamic tensor aliasing: Allows reinterpreting the same scalar block as different tensor shapes without copying data.
- Semantic querying: Enables retrieval of objects by tags (e.g., "temperature", "pressure").
- Batch retrieval: Supports efficient extraction of multiple objects in a single operation.

Installation:
The project can be installed via pip after cloning the repository and running 'pip install -e .' in the project directory. It requires Python >= 3.9 and numpy >= 1.23.

Core Components:
1. SLHDAMVP Class (store.py): Handles the storage of scalar data in a binary file and metadata in a JSON ledger. Provides methods for storing objects, retrieving them, aliasing (creating new views with different shapes/tags), and querying by tags.

2. Interpreter Class (interpreter.py): Acts as a semantic reconstruction and aliasing layer. Provides higher-level methods for retrieving, reshaping, aliasing, and batch querying objects.

3. Utils (utils.py): Contains utility functions like UUID generation.

Examples and Usage:
- Quickstart example: Storing a 2x2 grid, retrieving it, and creating a flat vector alias.
- Multi-scale simulation example: Storing a 4x4 grid and creating aliases as vector or subgrid.
- Performance: Capable of storing and retrieving 1 million scalars in milliseconds.

The project includes example scripts (demo.py) and a Jupyter notebook (demo_usage.ipynb) demonstrating practical usage, including initialization, storage, aliasing, querying, batch retrieval, and performance testing.
